Here's a suggested repository structure along with a brief explanation of each component. This structure separates your simulation logic, forecasting models, utility functions, configuration/data files, tests, and documentation. You can adapt it to suit your project’s size and complexity.

### Component Breakdown

- **README.md & docs/**  
  Provide an overview of your project, installation instructions, and detailed design documents. This helps onboard new developers and ensures clarity about the simulation’s purpose and design.

- **data/**  
  Keep historical data, configuration files, and any static datasets in this folder. This separation allows easy adjustments to input data without altering the simulation code.

- **src/**  
  Organize your core code into subdirectories based on functionality:
  - **simulation/**: Contains modules defining your supply chain nodes, simulation engine, and event scheduling.
  - **forecasting/**: Hosts your demand forecasting logic, making it easier to experiment with different models.
  - **logistics/**: Focuses on the movement of goods, transit delays, and order fulfillment logic.
  - **utils/**: Contains helper functions and logging utilities to support the main components.

- **tests/**  
  Unit tests ensure that individual modules behave as expected, while integration tests check that components work together. Organize tests to mirror the structure of your source code.

- **notebooks/**  
  Use Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, simulation result visualization, and quick prototyping of forecasting models.

### Tips for Effective Organization

- **Modular Design:**  
  Keep modules loosely coupled so that changes in one part (like forecasting models) don’t affect the simulation core.

- **Configurable Parameters:**  
  Externalize parameters (e.g., reorder thresholds, transit times) into configuration files. This allows you to adjust the simulation without modifying code.

- **Documentation and Comments:**  
  Document your code extensively and maintain an up-to-date design document. This is especially useful when you plan to iterate or expand the simulation.

- **Version Control:**  
  Use Git branches for experimental features and merge only tested, stable code into your main branch.

This organization will not only help maintain a clean codebase but also facilitate collaboration, testing, and future enhancements in your retail supply chain simulation.
